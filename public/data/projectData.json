    "description": "We designed an advanced forecasting system using the XGBoost Machine Learning Model to predict the Kp Index on Earth, leveraging data from the DSCOVR satellite situated at the L1 point, 1 million km away. This serves as an early warning mechanism for geomagnetic storms. we faced the challenge of data gaps, we introduced an additional time-series model to synthesize data. The significant solution here is harnessing the capability of an older-generation satellite, situated a million km from Earth, to predict potentially impactful geomagnetic disturbances.",
